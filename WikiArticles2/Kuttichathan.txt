Kuttichathan is a mischievous demon in Malabar demonology. He is a well-nourished 12-year-old who is sometimes described having a forelock. Some of Kuttichathan's tricks are agonizing (his victims' clothes might turn on fire, their food might turn into excrement, their beds might become a bed of thorns), but they never do any serious harm. Kuttichathan only requests food in return for his services.In Kerala, Kuttichathan is believed to be vengeful with people who stop trying to appease him. If they do not sacrifice a cock on a regular basis with the correct incantations, Kuttichathan will instill fear by playing horrendous pranks on a family, which causes them much misery.
